# Coffee Sales Dashboard - Excel

This project showcases my Excel skills for data analysis by developing an interactive
 dashboard that visualizes the sales performance of a fictional coffee shop
 from 2019 to August 2022. The dashboard provides insights into key 
performance indicators (KPIs) and trends, enabling informed decision-making for the business.

**Project Objectives:**

- Show expertise in Excel data cleaning, manipulation, and analysis.
- Use sophisticated Excel features such as PivotTables, charts, and formulas to give a summary of sales data by visualizing the same.
- Create an interactive dashboard which will enable the users to filter data through slicers and to analyze data from various points of view.
- Observe sales trends, most selling products, and changes in sales throughout particular periods.
- Put an emphasis on graphical method of data representation. Visualize findings through graphs and charts in a clear and concise manner.

**Dataset:**

The project is based on a simulated dataset where sales transactions of the coffee shop are stored. Some of the information that is included in the dataset are as follows:

- **Date & Time:** Record of every sale's date and time
- **Product:** Name of the coffee, beverage, snack, bakery, etc. that was sold
- **Category:** Product group
- **Quantity:** Number of items sold
- **Price:** Per article price

**Dashboard Features:**

The main activities in the interactive dashboard are as follows:

**Overall Sales Performance graph will be provided which will include:**

- Revenue by month and year
- Quantity sold by month and year
- The average price of the transaction
- The year-on-year sales growth comparison

**Product Performance graph will be provided which will include:**

- Top-selling products by revenue and quantity
- Product category piece
- Each product's sales are a part of the totality of revenue

**Interactive Filters:**

- Slicers for year, month, product category, and payment method
- Dynamic charts and tables that update based on filter selections

**Skills Demonstrated:**

- **Data Cleaning and Preparation:** Eliminating duplicates, addressing missing values, and formatting data.

- **PivotTables:** Creating and using PivotTables to summarize and analyze sales data.

- **Charts and Graphs:** Developing visually compelling charts (line charts, bar charts, etc.) to display sales trends and insights.

- **Formulas and Functions:** Using functions in Excel including SUM, AVERAGE, COUNTIF, or XLOOKUP for calculations and data manipulation.

- **Dashboard Design:** Designing a dashboard layout that presents the data in an interactive and user-friendly format, including slicers and filters.

**Project Outcome:** 

The Coffee Shop Sales Dashboard gives a full overview of the performance of the business in the last four years. The
 insights generated from the dashboard can be used to:

- Determine opportunities for growth or enhancement.

- Strengthen product offerings and define pricing.

- Market to the best opportunities.

- Create efficiency in operations.

- Use data-based forecasts to enhance profitability.

Project Future Enhancements:

- Include other data sources, including weather, to model how the data affects sales.

- Develop forecasting models for future sales.

- Develop more visually compelling and interactive elements.

This project has demonstrated my ability to utilize the
 powerful features of Excel to analyze real life data and 
develop actionable insight for business decisions. I believe
 these skills can be used across many data analysis projects
 in a variety of industries.
